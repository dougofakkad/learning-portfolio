                <p>As an experienced problem-solver in learning design and the software that supports it, my current role has given me lots of scope for creating learning materials and shaping the workflows that produce them. I have extensive experience in producing learning material for the diverse needs of the automotive industry, encompassing technical curricula as well as compliance and H&S. At various points this has involved authoring courses in Storyline, producing short films, creating illustrations and animation, and creating modules in HTML. My passion is designing learning materials that fully engage users, and I am seeking a role where I can have a transformative impact on the learning design process.</p>
